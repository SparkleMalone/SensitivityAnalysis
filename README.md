# SensitivityAnalysis
 A sensitivity analysis is a technique used to understand how changes in the inputs of a mathematical model or system affect the output. In the context of a model, such as a simulation or a statistical model, sensitivity analysis helps to identify which input parameters have the most significant influence on the results.
